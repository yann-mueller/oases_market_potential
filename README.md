<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; font-size: medium;"><span id="divtagdefaultwrapper" style="font-size: 12pt;">The literature has provided broad evidence for the historical relevance of market potential for economic growth. However, the evidence for the contemporaneous effect of market potential is less conclusive, especially for emerging economies. Therefore, this paper attempts to identify the causal effect of market potential in the Maghreb region. To this end, I construct a novel instrument that exploits a location's exposure to geographic conditions that favored the cultivation of a historical oasis. Contrary to recent observations in the literature, I find an increase in the effect of domestic market potential on annual growth rates over the past 30 years.</span></span></p>
